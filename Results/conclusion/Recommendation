Customer Segments
The customer base was segmented into three groups, each with distinct characteristics:

1. Group 1: Average Customers
Income: Average
Purchasing Behavior: Moderate spending, engages with campaigns (especially discount-related)
Shopping Habits: Shops online more frequently than the other groups
Key Insight: This group tends to make more purchases when discounts are offered. They are likely to respond well to targeted promotions or campaigns.
2. Group 2: Low-Income and Low-Engagement Customers
Income: Low
Purchasing Behavior: Minimal spending, low engagement with campaigns
Shopping Habits: Frequently visits the online store homepage but rarely makes purchases
Key Insight: Although this group spends little and doesnâ€™t often engage in campaigns, they spend time browsing the website. The company could consider targeted promotions and incentives to convert these visits into sales.
3. Group 3: High-Income and High-Spending Customers
Income: High
Purchasing Behavior: High spending, accepts campaigns but not influenced by discounts
Shopping Habits: Prefers in-store or catalog shopping, with moderate online purchases
Key Insight: This group is not strongly attracted by discounts but has a high purchasing ability. They tend to shop in physical stores or via catalogs, so offline promotions or exclusive offers may be more effective.
Conclusion
The second group (Low-Income and Low-Engagement Customers) represents nearly half of the total customer base. Although they spend little, they visit the online store frequently. The company could increase promotional efforts, particularly targeting this group to convert visits into purchases.
The first and third groups (Average and High-Income Customers) represent a smaller portion of the customer base, but they have higher purchasing potential. Offering tailored campaigns to these segments could boost their engagement and spending.
Recommendations
For Group 1 (Average Customers):
Launch more targeted campaigns that offer discounts and promotions, especially online. Focus on increasing online engagement and repeat purchases.

For Group 2 (Low-Income and Low-Engagement Customers):
Consider offering incentives such as discounts or special deals to encourage purchases. Increase promotional activities on the website to convert browsing behavior into actual purchases.

For Group 3 (High-Income and High-Spending Customers):
Focus on providing exclusive offline promotions and loyalty rewards. Since they are less influenced by online discounts, tailor the campaigns to suit their preferences for in-store and catalog shopping.
