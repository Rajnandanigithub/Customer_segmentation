# Customer_segmentation
customer segmentation  using k means 
This project involves performing customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, income, and engagement levels, providing valuable insights that can help tailor marketing campaigns and improve customer experiences.

**Methodology**

_Data Collection and Preprocessing_:
The dataset used for this project includes customer information such as income, spending behavior, and engagement with online and in-store campaigns. Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.

_Principal Component Analysis (PCA)_:
PCA was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. This helped in simplifying the dataset and improving the performance of the clustering algorithm by transforming it into a set of principal components.

_K-Means Clustering:_
K-Means clustering was applied to categorize the customers into three distinct groups. The algorithm was chosen due to its efficiency in partitioning data into non-overlapping clusters. The number of clusters was selected based on domain knowledge and clustering evaluation metrics.

_Cluster Analysis and Profiling:_
After applying K-Means clustering, the resulting customer groups were analyzed and interpreted based on their purchasing behavior, income levels, engagement with campaigns, and online shopping tendencies.
